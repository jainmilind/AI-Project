##### using Genetic Algorithms with Heuristic Searches, Random Search, Grid Search, Fuzzy Search, SVM based Rule Extraction Techniques, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization and Ensemble Learning


# Tips by Milind Jain:
- Make a superfolder with your name
- Make all Codes of a paper in a different folder to avoid confusion
- Add markdown in your code before every cell so that code is easily explainable and looks original.
- Try to use good coding practices like good variable naming, proper code formatting etc..
- Try to use a autoformatter for your code like AutoPep8 which will make all code look uniform and good :sunglasses:
- Add all your datasets in  [datasets](./datasets)
- To access the dataset you want to use
Do something like 
```py
df = pd.read_csv('../../datasets/tic-tac-toe.csv')
```
Here, `..` serves exactly same purpose as `cd ..`
- Add your papers in [Papers](./Papers/) so that its easily accessible
- Don't touch others code (unless they ask you to)
